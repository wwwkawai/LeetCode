You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        reverse(matrix.begin(),matrix.end());
        for(int i=0;i<matrix.size();i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<i;j++)
            {
                swap(matrix[i][j],matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
    }
};
/*
after we rotate the image by 90 degrees, we can find that, first, the new matrix's elements' row equal to the old's column, second, the 
new's column equal to n-1 substract the old's row. And we notice that transpose the matrix can achive the first step and filp the matrix horizontally can implement the second step.
